## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite apps: 
1. VSCO
    a) the lack of "traditional social media features" such as follow count & like count to preserve the mission of the app as a photo sharing platform focused on art and photography. 
    b) The "spaces" feature to explore daily themes  such as "concrete jungles" and "naturemorte", allowing for the sharing of photography and art across people 
2. Snapchat 
    a) Snapmap allows you to see where exactly you took every snap you saved to memory, helped me out so many times when I was trying to find a location of a restuarant from a picture or where I parked my bike last. 
    b) One year agos - I love all features that provides nostelgia, especially for a memory capturing app like Snapchat 

3. Spotify 
    a) Spotify Wrapped - allows you to explore and analyze trends about yourself over a year, a reflective feature with a fun twist 
    b) Daylist - utilizing their algorithm to recommend you songs at every part of the day, based on your previous listening habits that hour of that day of the week. 
    
4. Opal 
    a) Very specific focus scores that breaks down the % of times you were focused every hour, allowing you to pinpoint when you can improve productivity 
    b) An app-blocker that actually works - utilizing strategies such as ads to make someone less likely to skip past the screen time alert 
    
App Idea: 
A habit tracker app that goes beyond manual input and includes incentive meatures. It integrates data from your screen time and app usage patterns to create a personalized goal and habit-tracking experience. One problem that I see with exisiting habit tracking apps is that it often lose effectiveness due to lack of engagement and incentive. This app will implement the following features: 
    1. Seamless Data Integration: Automatically tracks your screen time and app usage habits to provide actionable insights.
    2. App Limiting Integration: Includes built-in app-blocking tools to help you reduce distractions and stay focused on your habits.
    3. Gamified Motivation: Encourages consistency through engaging gamification, where users earn points, unlock achievements, and compete with friends or a community.

## Notes

Some challenges I had was getting used to the Swift language (which is kind of like the reverse of the other coding langauges. Also, it was challenging getting used to connecting the button to the coding interface to modify its behavior.
